Explain how the internet works, explain how data are sent through the internet via packets, and describe the differences between the Internet and the World Wide Web. . Essential Knowledge . The internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocols. | Access to the internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an internet connected device. | A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system. | The protocols used int he internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the internet. | Routing on the internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance | The scalability of a system is the capacity for hte system to change in size and scale to meet new demands. | The internet was designed to be scalable. | Information is passed through the internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets. | Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly. | Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all. | IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the internet. | The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files. | HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web. | The World Wide Web uses the internet | . A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system. OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) The layers you have to go through to communicate. IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) manages the development of standards and technical discussions concerning the internet in an open and collaborative process.

            "content": "Performance Task . For my project for APCSP, I want to make a quiz through code.org that will ask the person questions about your personality and then decide a major that will fit you well. . The input will change by the person&#39;s response, and based on the person&#39;s stats that will be stored in Info.dB. Then the computer will compare their results with results from three to five majors I have chosen, and using that data, the computer will assign a major to the person. . Data Abstraction . The coding in this project will consist of mostly data and storing it through different types of code. I have to limit the input that a person can give, so it is easier for the code to compare it to a major that has similar data. I want to have at least 10 questions. . Managing Complexity . This is still in a work in progress, but the main objective of this idea is to compare data and work similar to MBTI tests and tests that ask you questions about your personality and compare the results to a major that produced similar results. There will be two different types of data types and by comparing similar results, it will make complexity as it compares both results. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure is storing data through the person&#39;s input contributes to the results of the program (matching their personality with a major).This procedure will be named personality abstraction, and there will be multiple parameters such as whether if they are an introvert/extrovert, in what spaces they are productive, if they like working with people or not, if they lean towards stem or liberal arts, etc. . Algorithm Implementation . The algorithm will be based on their personality and what choices they choose from the 10 questions. Choose MBTI, choose working personality, productivity, and receive major will be the iteration. Characteristics of certain majors will be chosen (based on the input of the person). Once this algorithm is developed, it will be thoroughly discussed. . Testing . The testing will be done on video, with me explaining each section, including a written explanation on each section. .",

            "content": "Video 1 . Learning Objectives . For errors in an algorithm or program, the goal is to identify the error. . Essential Knowledge . There are four types of errors. . A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly. | A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed. | A run-time ero-ror is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages define their own runtime errors. | An overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values. | . Programmers are constantly running into errors when they program. . In fact, it is an expectation that errors are a part of the programming process. | Proficient programmers can identify errors as one of the following types: Logic error this error is caused by programmer making a mistake in the algorithm, which causes the program to behave unexpectedly. | For example, the following code segment is intended to display the letter grade that corresponds to a percentage | . | Syntax error this is a mistake when a programmer makes a type or writes some code that doesn&#39;t follow the rules of the language | syntax errors cause the program to fail to run/compile | common examples of this are forgetting to include: colon/semicolon | parenthesis | curly braces | indentation | quotes | variable definition | . | . | Run-time error A run-time error is when a program fails in the midst of running | This error is commonly referred to as a &quot;bug&quot; | The key to identifying a run-time error is that the program runs/compiles initially, but fails and cannot complete its processes | A run-time error may result from: dividing by zero | inappropriately entered data type | many other advanced possibilities | . | . | Overflow error an overflow error is when a program is required to perform a calculation that is outside of defined range of values | Due to memory allocation constraints that programming languages require, certain values are too big to calculate and/or display | . | . | . Video 2 . Learning Objectives . For errors in an algorithm or program, the goal is to correct the error. . Essential Knowledge . The following are effective ways to find and correct errors: . test cases | hand tracing | visualizations | debuggers | adding extra output statement | . What do we do once we have identified an error? . The easiest error to correct is usually the syntax error. . Most integrated development environments (IDEs) display information when there is a syntax error | This information usually directs the programmer to the line in the program where the error has occurred | Sometimes the user needs to do a little digging to find the error The more difficult errors to find and correct are logic errors. | A logic error is not always immediately noticed | Using test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors | For example, the program on the next slide can be used to display a letter grade that corresponds to a percentage, but does not work correctly due to a logic error. | . The next strategy to try is hand tracing . Hand tracing can be most useful with iteration. . Hand tracing is simply writing out the values of the variables within the loop as it iterates to determine if the outcome is correct | Hand tracing can be useful for small code segments and loops that iterate a small number of times | Larger code segments or loops might require a debugging program | . What did hand tracing find out? . Hand tracing showed us that the algorithm was actually just displaying the last time a number was less than the number after if in a list | What if we used {1, 4, 0, 3, 2} as our list? | The algorithm would have displayed 0 as the minimum | Hence the need for multiple, varying test cases. | To correct this algorithm, we would need to ask if the min &lt; list[index] rather than list[index] &lt; list[index+1] | And repeat LENGTH(list) times | . Another strategy is adding extra output statements . A programmer would use this strategy to help find and fix an error. | Once the error is corrected, the extra output statements are usually removed. | This has a similar effect as hand tracing, but allows the computer to do more of the work. | . Video 3 . Learning Objectives . Identify inputs and corresponding expected outputs or behaviors that can be used to check the correctness of an algorithm or program . Essential Knowledge . In the development process, testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes. Programmers use the results from testing to revise their algorithms or programs | Defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes (minimum and maximum) of input data | Program requirements are needed to identify appropriate defined inputs for testing. | . When do we start testing a program? . Programmers start testing a program at the onset of development . Or at least, they start thinking about testing | As soon as programmers determine the program specifications, they start trying to answer the question: &quot;How will we know if the program is working properly?&quot; | . | . Specifications influence testing . Recall that the program specifications list the behaviors, events, and corresponding responses/outputs the program is to support. | Programmers need to define inputs that will determine whether or not the program specifications are met | . How does this influence program development? . Once the inputs and corresponding outputs are determined, programmers test, test, and test. | After testing, programmers use the results the revise, refine, and improve their programs. | And then they test them again and again. | After the programmers test, then users test, and then the programmers refine even more, | And finally, the program is released. | . Hacks . What errors may arise in your project? | . There can be many errors in my project because I am a beginner at programming, but I believe I will have trouble with coding and have a lot of syntax errors. . What are some test cases that can be used? | . I can use hand tracing and look over everything by hand. .

Things I am very grateful for: . my family for always being there for me | food and water that I eat every day | going to school everyday | being healthy and able to move and exercise | my friends and places I go with them | . Gratitude to my Friend . A message I wrote to them: &quot;Thank you so much for being my friend for such long time and putting up with me everyday. You are such a kind and beautiful person and you mean so much to me.&quot; . Gratitude to someone at home . A message I wrote to my parents: &quot;Thank you for being there everyday for me and taking care of me everyday. I am so grateful for having parents like you and you are so amazing and inspirational and my role models. I hope you live for a very long time so I will be able to help you like you help me everyday. I love you.&quot; . Goals . Academic: I want to be productive and hard-working through my whole career, and I hope I study things without getting distracted. I will maintain my health while studying and work hard. | Personal Life: I want to maintain my mental and physical health and care more about myself than others. I want to do things I enjoy and pursue my interests instead of others. | Social Life: I want to keep in touch with my family and call my family who lives in Korea every week. I hope I don&#39;t drift from my friends and enjoy my time with my family and friends. | . Personal Journey in CSP . I want to learn more about coding in different languages like Python, Java, and maybe C++. I also want to successfully finish my project for this class. . Things I did for myself . On Saturday, my family and I drove to LA to eat out to my family&#39;s favorite place. It has been a long time since we have done this and it was a great way to catch up with each other&#39;s life and enjoy each other&#39;s presence while having a delicious food. I enjoy being with a lot of people and this really helped me distress over school and other things. .",

            "content": "Idea 1 . Performance Task . For my project for APCSP, I want to make a quiz through code.org that will ask the person questions about your personality and then decide a major that will fit you well. . The input will change by the person’s response, and based on the person’s stats that will be stored in Info.dB. Then the computer will compare their results with results from three to five majors I have chosen, and using that data, the computer will assign a major to the person. . Data Abstraction . The coding in this project will consist of mostly data and storing it through different types of code. I have to limit the input that a person can give, so it is easier for the code to compare it to a major that has similar data. I want to have at least 10 questions. . Managing Complexity . This is still in a work in progress, but the main objective of this idea is to compare data and work similar to MBTI tests and tests that ask you questions about your personality and compare the results to a major that produced similar results. There will be two different types of data types and by comparing similar results, it will make complexity as it compares both results. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure is storing data through the person’s input contributes to the results of the program (matching their personality with a major).This procedure will be named personality abstraction, and there will be multiple parameters such as whether if they are an introvert/extrovert, in what spaces they are productive, if they like working with people or not, if they lean towards stem or liberal arts, etc. . Algorithm Implementation . The algorithm will be based on their personality and what choices they choose from the 10 questions. Choose MBTI, choose working personality, productivity, and receive major will be the iteration. Characteristics of certain majors will be chosen (based on the input of the person). Once this algorithm is developed, it will be thoroughly discussed. . Testing . The testing will be done on video, with me explaining each section, including a written explanation on each section. . Idea 2 . Performance Task . For my project for APCSP, I want to make a website that will record your mood and will be essentially a mood tracker. . The input will change by the person’s response, and based on the person’s stats that will be stored in Info.dB. Then the computer will organize the data into a table and then transform into a graph. . Data Abstraction . The coding in this project will consist of mostly data and storing it through different types of code. I have to limit the input that a person can give to 5 different moods, so it is easier for the code store it. . Managing Complexity . This is still in a work in progress, but the main objective of this idea is to compare data and to organize it by every day, month, and year. I will put the data into a table and develop a procedure, where they will put the information into a table. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure is storing data through the person’s input, and will be tracking how the person feels while also noticing different types of patterns and major differences in their mood on a daily basis. . Algorithm Implementation . The algorithm will be based on their mood and organize their thoughts. Another feature that can be added to the website is that the person could share why they are in this mood, which will be recorded and can be viewed later. Once this algorithm is developed, it will be thoroughly discussed. . Testing . The testing will be done on video, with me explaining each section, including a written explanation on each section. .",

The format said to do three questions, so I thought of three questions to ask for my quiz. However, one thing I wanted to change for my quiz that is different from the example is that when we chose an incorrect answer, it would not react. That is why I wanted to make something that would not do that. . I brainstormed and planned with my partner, Annika. Together we thought about quiz topics or things that we were interested in. I chose movies, because there are a lot of questions we can use with that topic. For the questions, we decided for each question there will be four options but one answer. I chose three questions, two focused on disney princesses and one focused on disneyland in general. One thing I would fix from the quiz was to make it go to a page where it says that it is incorrect if you pressed the wrong button. . Data Abstraction . Since I am using java script for this quiz, I learned new code. Even though code.org showed blocks instead of code, there was a button where you could type it out. I find that way more easier to code. I used the UI Control On Event and made it print out which button the player picked when a button was pressed on. The destination of where the button takes you changed for each button, and only one for each page takes you to the next question, while the other three take you to a different page. This is a screenshot of my code. . . I made a new page where it shows that you got it wrong and made it so that if you got a question wrong, then you have to click another button to return to the homepage until you got everything correct, then it will show a page where it says you got a 3/3 or 100%. . Final Result . This is the link to my page and I hope you had fun on my quiz! .",

Chemical Foundations 2 . Units of Measure . A quantitative observation, or measurement, ALWAYS consists of two parts: a number and a unit. . Two major measurements systems exist: English (US and some of Africa) and Metric (the rest of the globe!) • SI system – 1960 an international agreement was reached to set up a system of units so scientists everywhere could better communicate measurements. Le Système International in French; all based upon or derived from the metric system . KNOW THE UNITS AND PREFIXES shown in BLUE!!! . • Volume – derived from length; consider a cube 1m on each edge ∴1.0 m3 . - A decimeter is 1/10 of a meter so . (1m)3 = (10 dm)3= 103 dm3= 1,000 dm3 . 1dm3 = 1 liter (L) and is slightly larger than a quart also . 1dm3 = 1 L = (10 cm)3= 103cm3 = 1,000 cm3 = 1,000 mL . AND 1 cm3 = 1 mL = 1 gram of H2O (at 4ºC if you want to be picky) . Mass vs. Weight – chemists are quite guilty of using these terms interchangeably. . o mass (g or kg) – a measure of the resistance of an object to a change in its state of motion (i.e. exhibits inertia); the quantity of matter present . o weight (a force∴ has units of Newtons) – the response of mass to gravity; since all of our measurements will be made here on Earth, we consider the acceleration due to gravity a constant so we’ll use the terms interchangeably as well although it is technically incorrect! We “weigh” chemical quantities on a balance NOT a scale!! . Chemical Foundations 3 . Gravity – varies with altitude here on planet Earth . • The closer you are to the center of the Earth, the stronger the gravitational field SINCE it originates from the center of the Earth. . • Every object has a gravitational field – as long as you’re on Earth, they are masked since the Earth’s field is so HUGE compared to the object’s. . • The strength of the gravitational field ∝ mass . • Ever seen astronauts in space that are “weightless” since they are very far removed from the center of Earth? Notice how they are constantly “drawn” to the sides of the ship and must push away? . • The ships’ mass is greater than the astronaut’s mass ∴ “g” is greater for the ship and the astronaut is attracted to the ship just as you are attracted to Earth! The moon has 61 the mass of the Earth ∴ you would experience 61 the gravitational field you experience on Earth and ∴ you’d WEIGH 61 of what you weigh on Earth. . Precision and Accuracy .

To check the accuracy of a graduated cylinder, a student filled the cylinder to the 25-mL mark using water delivered from a buret and then read the volume delivered. Following are the results of five trials: . Trial Volume Shown by Volume Shown . Graduated Cylinder by the Buret . 1 25 mL 26.54 mL . 2 25 mL 26.51 mL . 3 25 mL 26.60 mL . 4 25 mL 26.49 mL . 5 25 mL 26.57 mL . Average 25 mL 26.54 mL . Is the graduated cylinder accurate? . Note that the average value measured using the buret is significantly different from 25 mL. Thus, this graduated cylinder is not very accurate. It produces a systematic error (in this case, the indicated result is low for each measurement). . Chemical Foundations 4 . Significant Figures and Calculations . Determining the Number of Significant Figures (or Digits) in a Measurement . • Nonzero digits are significant. (Easy enough to identify!) . • A zero is significant IF and ONLY IF it meets one of the conditions below: . - The zero in question is “terminating AND right” of the decimal [must be both] . - The zero in question is “sandwiched” between two significant figures . • Exact or counting numbers have an ∞ amount of significant figures as do fundamental constants (never to be confused with derived constants) . Exercise 2 Significant Figures (SF) . Give the number of significant figures for each of the following experimental results. . a. A student’s extraction procedure on a sample of tea yields 0.0105 g of caffeine. . b. A chemist records a mass of 0.050080 g in an analysis. . c. In an experiment, a span of time is determined to be 8.050 × 10‒3 s . . a. three; b. five; c. four . Reporting the Result of a Calculation to the Proper Number of Significant Figures . • When × and ⎟ , the term with the least number of significant figures (∴least accurate measurement) determines the number of maximum number of significant figures in the answer. (It’s helpful to underline the digits in the least significant number as a reminder.) . 4.56 × 1.4 = 6.38 corrected → 6.4 . • When + and (−), the term with the least number of decimal places (∴least accurate measurement) determines the number of significant figures in the final answer. . 12.11 . 18.0 ← limiting term (only 1 decimal place) . 1.013 . 31.123 → corrected 31.1 (limits the overall answer to only one decimal place) . • pH – the number of significant figures in least accurate measurement determines number decimal places on the reported pH (usually explained in the appendix of your text) . Rounding Guidelines for the AP Exam and This Course: . • Round ONLY at the end of all calculations (keep the numbers in your calculator) . • Examine the significant figure one place beyond your desired number of significant figures. IF &gt; 5 round up; &lt; 5 drop the remaining digits. . • Don’t “double round”! Example: The number 7.348 rounded to 2 SF is reported as 7.3 In other words, DO NOT look beyond the 4 after the decimal and think that the 8 rounds the 4 up to a five which in turn makes the final answer 7.4. . [Even though you may have conned a teacher into rounding your final average this way before!] Chemical Foundations 5 . Dimensional Analysis . Example: Consider a straight pin measuring 2.85 cm in length. Calculate its . length in inches. . Start with a conversion factor such as 2.54 cm = 1 inch ∴ you can write TWO . Conversion factors: 1 in . 2.54 cmor 2.54 cm . 1 in . Why is this legal? Both quantities . represent the exact same “thing” so the conversion factor is actually equal to “1”. . To convert the length of the pin from cm to inches, simply multiply your given quantity by a conversion factor you engineer so that it “cancels” the undesirable unit and places the desired unit where you want it. For our example, we want inches in the numerator so our numerical answer is not reported in reciprocal inches! Thus, . 2.85 cm 1 in . ⋅ = 1.12 in . 2.54 cm . Let’s practice! . Exercise 3 . A pencil is 7.00 in. long. Calculate the length in centimeters? . 17.8 cm . Exercise 4 . You want to order a bicycle with a 25.5-in. frame, but the sizes in the catalog are given only in centimeters. What size should you order? . 64.8 in . Exercise 5 . A student has entered a 10.0-km run. How long is the run in miles? . We have kilometers, which we want to change to miles. We can do this by the following route: kilometers → meters → yards → miles . To proceed in this way, we need the following equivalence statements (conversion factors): . 1 km = 1000 m . 1 m = 1.094 yd . 1760 yd = 1 mi . 6.22 mi Chemical Foundations 6 . Exercise 6 . The speed limit on many highways in the United States is 55 mi/h. What number would be posted if expressed in kilometers per hour? . 88 km/h . Exercise 7 . A Japanese car is advertised as having a fuel economy of 15 km/L. Convert this rating to miles per gallon. . 35 mi /gal . Temperature . I suspect you are aware there are three temperature scales commonly in use today. A comparison follows: . Notice a degree of temperature change on the Celsius scale represents the same quantity of change on the Kelvin scale. . Chemical Foundations 7 . Density . mass . Density = volume . Exercise 8 Determining Density . A chemist, trying to identify the main component of a compact disc cleaning fluid, determines that 25.00 cm3 of the substance has a mass of 19.625 g at 20°C. Use the information in the table below to identify which substance may serve as the main component of the cleaning fluid. Justify your answer with a calculation. . Compound Density (g/cm3) at 20°C . Chloroform 1.492 . Diethyl ether 0.714 . Ethanol 0.789 . Isopropyl alcohol 0.785 . Toluene 0.867 . Density = 0.7850 g / cm3∴ isopropyl alcohol . Classification of Matter . States of Matter (mostly a vocabulary lesson) . ▪ Be very, very clear that changes of state involve altering IMFs not altering actual chemical bonds!! ▪ solid – rigid; definite shape and volume; molecules close together vibrating about fixed points ∴ virtually incompressible . ▪ liquid – definite volume but takes on the shape of the container; molecules still vibrate but also have rotational and translational motion and can slide past one another BUT are still close together ∴ slightly compressible . ▪ gas – no definite volume and takes on the shape of the container; molecules vibrate, rotate and translate and are independent of each other ∴ VERY far apart ∴ highly compressible . - vapor – the gas phase of a substance that is normally a solid or liquid at room temperature - fluid – that which can flow; gases and liquids . • Mixtures – can be physically separated . - homogeneous – have visibly indistinguishable . parts, solutions including air . - heterogeneous – have visibly distinguishable parts . - means of physical separation include: filtering, . fractional crystallization, distillation, . chromatography . Chemical Foundations 8 . Paper Chromatography: Distillation: . Paper chromatograph of ink. (a) A line of the mixture to be separate . is placed at one end of a sheet of porous paper. (b) The paper acts as . a wick to draw up the liquid. (c) The component with the weakest . attraction for the paper travels faster than those that cling to the paper. . • Pure substances – compounds like water, carbon dioxide etc. and elements. Compounds can be separated into elements by chemical means . - electrolysis is a common chemical method for separating compounds into . elements . - elements can be broken down into atoms which can be further broken down into . - nuclei and electrons . - p+, n0 and e- . - quarks . Electrolysis is an example of a . chemical change. In this apparatus, . water is decomposed to hydrogen gas . (filling the red balloon) and Oxygen . gas (filling the blue balloon). .
