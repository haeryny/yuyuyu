    "- We are not stuck at a certain spot, and the things can be improved. We can control a lot more of our happiness.\n",
    "- Taking control of our life is very difficult sometimes, and we should not undermine ourselves if we fail\n",
    "- Do not rely on what single thing to achieve happiness, for example, lottery wins are not as important and only affect a small part of us, compared to what we think\n",
    "- Happiness is achieved not a single moment, but multiples things that build up to another\n",
    "- Friendships and being social is a very important part of daily life as well as helping others and being grateful towards them\n",
    "- Have self-care and care for yourself, exercise and do something good for your own well being\n",
    "- Be patient and be present in the moment, realize that we are staring at our phones and we should look up and enjoy our lives as they are right now"
