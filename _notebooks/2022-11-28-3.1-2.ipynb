    "I got the last question wrong, and that's because I forgot which order it went and that it does not repeat at all. I now know that the correct answer is because the variables have values thanks to the previous five statements. In the sixth sentence, b is given the value of x + b, which is 40. The seventh sentence gives a the value of x + 1, or 21. The value of c + d / 2 is assigned to d in the ninth sentence. Division takes priority over addition in the order of operations. The number 50 is given to d since c is 30 and d / 2 is 20. The values of a, b, c, and d are shown in the final four assertions.\n",
