    "## Essential Knowledge\n",
    "- A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature\n",
    "- There are multiple development processes. The following phrases are commonly used when developing a program:\n",
    "    - investigating and reflecting\n",
    "    - designing \n",
    "    - prototyping\n",
    "    - testing\n",
    "- A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phrases of the process. \n",
    "- A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.\n",
    "- The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.\n",
    "- Investigation ina  development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.\n",
    "- Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows:\n",
    "    - collecting data through surveys \n",
    "    - user testing\n",
    "    - interviews\n",
    "    - direct observations\n",
    "- Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.\n",
    "- A program's specification defines the requirements for the program\n",
    "- In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification\n",
    "- The design phase of a program may include:\n",
    "    - brainstorming\n",
    "    - planning and storyboarding\n",
    "    - organizing the program into modules and functional components\n",
    "    - creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface\n",
    "    - development of a testing strategy for the programs"
