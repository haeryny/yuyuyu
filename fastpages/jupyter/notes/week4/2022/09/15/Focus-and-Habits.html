<ul>
<li>We are not stuck at a certain spot, and the things can be improved. We can control a lot more of our happiness.</li>
<li>Taking control of our life is very difficult sometimes, and we should not undermine ourselves if we fail</li>
<li>Do not rely on what single thing to achieve happiness, for example, lottery wins are not as important and only affect a small part of us, compared to what we think</li>
<li>Happiness is achieved not a single moment, but multiples things that build up to another</li>
<li>Friendships and being social is a very important part of daily life as well as helping others and being grateful towards them</li>
<li>Have self-care and care for yourself, exercise and do something good for your own well being</li>
<li>Be patient and be present in the moment, realize that we are staring at our phones and we should look up and enjoy our lives as they are right now</li>

<p>On Saturday, my family and I drove to LA to eat out to my family's favorite place. It has been a long time since we have done this and it was a great way to catch up with each other's life and enjoy each other's presence while having a delicious food. I enjoy being with a lot of people and this really helped me distress over school and other things.</p>
