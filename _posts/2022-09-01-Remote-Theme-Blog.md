# Remote Theme Blog

I changed the theme of my blog to minimal, which moved my title to the right and put all my posts on the left. With this theme, you can apply a logo and also adds new features that I can use for my website. However, I noticed a few of my notebooks were lagging and breaking. 

This is the screenshot with my fastpage in the minimal theme mode.
