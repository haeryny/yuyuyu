# Idea 1

## Performance Task

For my project for APCSP, I want to make a quiz through code.org that will ask the person questions about your personality and then decide a major that will fit you well. 

The input will change by the person's response, and based on the person's stats that will be stored in Info.dB. Then the computer will compare their results with results from three to five majors I have chosen, and using that data, the computer will assign a major to the person. 

## Data Abstraction

The coding in this project will consist of mostly data and storing it through different types of code. I have to limit the input that a person can give, so it is easier for the code to compare it to a major that has similar data. I want to have at least 10 questions. 

## Managing Complexity

This is still in a work in progress, but the main objective of this idea is to compare data and work similar to MBTI tests and tests that ask you questions about your personality and compare the results to a major that produced similar results. 

For the other three rows, they will be made when I have started making my program and planning more in depth with my procedure. 

# Idea 2

## Performance Task

For my project for APCSP, I want to create a website that will let your document the things you did on that specific day, and will organize future plans.

The input will change by the person's response, and the person can mark which date, which the computer will sort into the corresponding, day, month, and year. The person could input their overall feeling during the data and the computer could track their mood and point out patterns or similarities.

## Data Abstraction

The coding in this project will consist of mostly data and storing it through different types of code. I have to limit the input that a person can give, so it is easier for the code to sort it. I am considering making a table that sorts out all the data and then I will make it more easier to see through he website. 

## Managing Complexity

This is still in a work in progress, but the main objective of this idea is to compare data and create graphs following that data while also showing things the person has accomplished. 

For the other three rows, they will be made when I have started making my program and planning more in depth with my procedure.
