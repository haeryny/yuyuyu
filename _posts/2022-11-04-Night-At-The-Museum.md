# Night at the Museum

## Classes I visited

I first visited Mr. Mortensen's classroom and looked at the APCSA projects as well as the other APCSP projects, they were really creative and one of them was a website about AP Calculus and its looked very helpful and I want to try and use it later. I also went to the digital media classroom where they showed things they made online and all of them had a common theme of donuts and was very cool. I also went to the AP Studio Art Classroom because I am also displaying my own art there and I saw a lot of art that very beautiful and amazing to look at. 

## Our Project

We came to the school at around 6:30 and got set up to present our project. It was journal that we developed that was because of the video we watched in APCSP about mental health. After we finished presenting to Mr. Yeung, we walked around the class and looked at other people's projects. Someone made a website where we could vote for our favorite song, it was cool to see all the people's thoughts gathered in once place.
