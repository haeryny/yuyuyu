# Week 2 Review Ticket

Things that were due:
<ol>
  <li>Using Python lists and dictionaries to record and make a quiz.</li>
  <li>Changing my remote theme and playing with the website format.</li>
  <li>Turning my website into dark mode and making new tags.</li>
  <li>Creating a table, which I made in the tags page.</li>
</ol>

### [Python Lists and Dictionaries](https://haeryny.github.io/yuyuyu/fastpages/jupyter/notes/week2/2022/08/30/Python-List-Notes.html)

I used the for loop twice in this notebook. I used it first to print out multiples outputs which were based on the tests and assignments I had in class along with the dates, type of test, and the material I should study. I used the for loop for the second time for the quiz I made, which took the inputs that I put in in Python and printed them out in a certain format. In this quiz, I can change the input into anything I want at any time.

### [Remote Theme Blog](https://haeryny.github.io/yuyuyu/markdown/week2/2022/09/01/Remote-Theme-Blog.html)

In this blog, you can see that I changed the theme from minima to minimal while also moving the title from the top to the left, while putting all the posts to the right. Personally I like this theme better than the standard one, but it is true that if I use this theme for too long, my website will not work anymore. I changed my theme by going into config.yml and changing the ending of jekyll. 

### Dark Mode

I have changed my website from light mode to dark mode by going into _sass and adding a new file named dark mode. By adding this also into another file in _sass, my website changed into dark mode, which is easier to use when you are studying when it is late. In addition, if you look in the link, I added new tags that are week 1 and week 2 by putting them in the brackets at the beginning of the post. 

### Table

If you look into the tags of my website, you can notice that there is table that indicated week 1 and week 2, which help me keep organized on what I am doing every week. This table was used by putting in the "<tr>" and the "<td>" code.
