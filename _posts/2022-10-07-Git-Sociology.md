### Hacks

- What is the main repository for your project?

The main repository for the project is lash and us as a group are adding things individually to the project. 
- Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control? Look at this tool for guidance.

Yes, we did. We are adding files to the .gitignore, but not that many right now. 
- Have you established Issues as part of your Development process? 

Yes, we post issues of our project every week.
- Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? 

We are naming the pull requests to track who does what and what we did to track our commitment and our development.
