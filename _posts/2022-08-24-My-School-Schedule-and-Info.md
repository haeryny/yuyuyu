# My School Schedule and Info

## Schedule

### 1st Period: Studio Art

I am taking this class in preparation for AP Studio Art, and it is very fun because there is a lot of freedom in this class as well as I enjoy drawing and painting.

### 2nd Period: AP Chemistry

I have Mr. Ozuna for AP Chemistry and I really enjoy the class and like the way he teaches with little hints to help us remember the material. 

### 3rd Period: AP Calculus

Mrs. Buehler is my teacher for AP Calculus and she reminds me of a teacher from middle school, and in addition, I really enjoy math so this is one of my favorite classes. 

### 4th Period: AP Computer Science P

My dad is also a computer engineer so he is the one who motivated, tutored, and convinced me to sign up for this class. Honestly, I am very greatful that she showed me this class, because I really enjoy it. 

### 5th Period: Off Roll

I am taking Off Roll because I am in the tennis team and matches start during 5th period.
