<p>For my quiz, I wanted to quiz people about disney movies and characters. The format said to do three questions, so I thought of three questions to ask for my quiz. However, one thing I wanted to change for my quiz that is different from the example is that when we chose an incorrect answer, it would not react. That is why I wanted to make something that would not do that.</p>

<p>I brainstormed and planned with my partner, Annika. Together we thought about quiz topics or things that we were interested in. I chose movies, because there are a lot of questions we can use with that topic. For the questions, we decided for each question there will be four options but one answer. I chose three questions, two focused on disney princesses and one focused on disneyland in general. One thing I would fix from the quiz was to make it go to a page where it says that it is incorrect if you pressed the wrong button.</p>

<p>Since I am using java script for this quiz, I learned new code. Even though code.org showed blocks instead of code, there was a button where you could type it out. I find that way more easier to code. I used the UI Control On Event and made it print out which button the player picked when a button was pressed on. The destination of where the button takes you changed for each button, and only one for each page takes you to the next question, while the other three take you to a different page. This is a screenshot of my code.</p>

<p>I made a new page where it shows that you got it wrong and made it so that if you got a question wrong, then you have to click another button to return to the homepage until you got everything correct, then it will show a page where it says you got a 3/3 or 100%.</p>
